description: Turn a frozen design contract (DESIGN.md + docs/design/ + page CONTRACT.md) into a running frontend skeleton — project structure, wired design tokens, page shells with all 10 system states, and correct routing for image generation and animation. Use when a design-contract-system contract exists and implementation must start, or when scaffolding a new frontend that must stay consistent with an established design system.

# Frontend Scaffold

Turn frozen design contracts into a running skeleton. The contract decides
*what* is built; this skill builds the smallest structure that satisfies it —
tokens wired, page shells generated, all 10 system states present, assets and
animation routed correctly.

## When to Activate

- `DESIGN.md` + `docs/design/` contracts exist (from `design-contract-system`) and implementation starts
- Scaffolding a new page or feature that must consume an existing page contract
- Adding image generation or animation to a frontend and needing the correct routing
- A skeleton exists but drifted from the contract (re-scaffold the affected files)

## Inputs (fail-closed gate)

Required on disk before any scaffolding:

1. `DESIGN.md` at project root — routing index to the 6 `docs/design/` files
2. `docs/design/TOKEN-MAP.md` + `docs/design/STATES-MATRIX.md` — the two files this skill consumes most
3. `docs/design/contracts/[FEATURE]-CONTRACT.md` for the page being built

If any is missing, STOP — run `design-contract-system` first. Never invent
tokens or states that the contract does not declare. The contract is a
read-only input; this skill generates code, it does not redesign.

> **Plans must name this skill.** A skill cannot force the harness to load it —
> an agent working from a plan file alone bypasses every phase below, including
> the Phase 5 audit gate. A plan implementing a contract-driven scaffold must
> say "execute under `frontend-scaffold`" (observed failure: a scaffold built
> from the plan alone shipped 14 contract violations under a green suite).

## Workflow

### Phase 0 — Read the Contract

Read `DESIGN.md`, then the page contract. Extract:
- Composition Spec (Section 5) — the measured per-section layout, alignment, typography, and behavior targets. Phase 5 verifies the render against these; they are not optional decoration.
- Component-to-token binding table (Section 3) — what to generate
- State matrix (Section 4) — which of the 10 states are in-scope vs `OUT_OF_SCOPE`
- Authorized roles and responsive breakpoints (1440 / 768 / 375)

### Phase 1 — Project Structure

Detect the framework before generating:

| Signal | Structure |
|--------|-----------|
| `next` in deps | Next.js App Router: `app/(group)/[feature]/page.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx` |
| `vite` + `react` in deps | `src/routes/[feature]/` + route-level `Suspense`/error boundaries |
| Greenfield full-stack SaaS | If a `saas-scaffolder` skill is available in your harness (operator-local, not repo-shipped), delegate the boilerplate to it, then return here for contract-driven pages |

Never mix conventions from both structures.

### Phase 2 — Wire Tokens

Copy the token architecture from `docs/design/THEME.md` into the project's
`globals.css` verbatim (both `html[data-theme="light"]` and `[data-theme="dark"]`
blocks). Rules:
- CSS custom properties are the only source of color values; components reference `var(--color-*)` or semantic Tailwind classes (`bg-surface`, `text-text-strong`)
- Exactly 3 radius tiers: `rounded-lg` (8px controls), `rounded-xl` (12px cards), `rounded-2xl` (16px modals); `rounded-full` only for badges/avatars/progress
- 4px spacing grid only (`p-1`…`p-12`); no `p-[13px]`, no `gap-1.5`
- Metrics and money: `font-sans tabular-nums` — never `font-mono`
- A token missing from the contract is a contract gap, not a license to invent — flag it and stop

### Phase 3 — Generate Page Shells

For each row of the contract's component table, generate one component file.
For each in-scope state in the contract's state matrix, generate its component.
Canonical 10 states (names match `page-contract.md`):

1. `Loading Skeleton` — aspect-ratio-matched skeleton grid
2. `Empty State` — first-run graphic + primary onboarding action
3. `No Search Result` — "clear filters" secondary state
4. `Error State` — component-level retry + human-readable message
5. `No Internet` — offline banner + cached-data timestamp
6. `Slow Network` — stale-data indicator without unmounting content
7. `Permission Denied` — access-restricted card
8. `Session Expired` — re-auth dialog trigger
9. `Form Validation` — inline field errors + border tokens
10. `Success State` — ephemeral toast/confirmation

States the contract marks `OUT_OF_SCOPE` are NOT generated — implement only
what the view actually has (e.g. a read-only dashboard skips Form Validation).
Data fetching uses `useQuery`-style hooks with explicit loading/error branches
(`frontend-patterns`); every branch renders a state component, never a bare
spinner.

### Phase 4 — Route Assets & Animation

**Image generation** (default path — no new keys):
- Use the harness tool `experimental_image_generate`
- Available models (catalog, all `cloudflare-workers-ai`): `@cf/black-forest-labs/flux-2-klein-9b` (general/UI reference), `@cf/leonardo/lucid-origin` and `@cf/leonardo/phoenix-1.0` (artistic/illustrative), `@cf/bytedance/stable-diffusion-xl-lightning` (fast drafts)
- Direction skills `imagegen-frontend-web` / `imagegen-frontend-mobile` (operator-local, not repo-shipped) govern prompt composition when available: one image per section, composition variety, single palette. If absent, compose prompts directly with those rules
- Verify output with `multimodal-looker`; save accepted images into the repo (`assets/` or `public/`) — the experimental tool is not a production CDN
- Programmatic/batch generation (fal.ai, OpenAI, Google AI Studio) is a separate opt-in requiring an owner-supplied key — not part of the default path

**Animation routing — by deliverable, not by preference:**

| Deliverable | Tool | Skill |
|-------------|------|-------|
| In-app UI animation (enter/exit, gestures, layout, scroll-linked) | `motion/react` | `motion-foundations` → `motion-patterns` → `motion-advanced` |
| Rendered video file (MP4 — demos, social, hero loops) | Remotion | `remotion-video-creation` |
| Presentation decks | — | `frontend-slides` |

Default is `motion/react`: hardware-accelerated, MIT license, 60/120fps while
the JS thread is busy. Reach for Remotion only when the deliverable is a video
file. GSAP is not recommended for general use (Webflow-owned license, banned
in Webflow competitors).

### Phase 5 — Audit Gate (canonical audit file, contract-owned)

Do NOT write your own audit test and do NOT audit only the staged diff — a
diff-scoped grep misses files committed earlier in the same session, and a
self-written audit is how contracts get quietly weakened (observed failure:
an agent whitelisted its own `rounded-md` output and dropped the spacing
check entirely, shipping 14 violations under a green suite).

**Write the canonical audit file into the project** so it runs in `npm test`
and CI, then make the code pass it:

`tests/design-contract-audit.test.js` (adapt the runner block to the project's
test framework; the rules below are the contract):

```js
// Contract-owned: rules mirror docs/design/STANDARDS.md + the page contract.
// Weakening these rules to make output pass is itself a contract violation.
const RADIUS_RE = /rounded-(sm|md|3xl|\[)/;
const SPACING_HALF_RE = /(?:gap|p|px|py|pt|pb|pl|pr|m|mx|my|mt|mb|ml|mr|space-x|space-y)-[0-9]+\.5/;
const GEOMETRY_ARBITRARY_RE = /(?:gap|p|px|py|pt|pb|pl|pr|m|mx|my|mt|mb|ml|mr|w|h|min-h|max-h|min-w|max-w|size|inset|top|right|bottom|left)-\[/;

it('audit rules must stay canonical (self-check)', () => {
  assert.ok(RADIUS_RE.test('rounded-md'), 'radius audit must flag rounded-md');
  assert.ok(SPACING_HALF_RE.test('gap-1.5'), 'spacing audit must flag .5 fractions');
  assert.ok(GEOMETRY_ARBITRARY_RE.test('h-['), 'geometry audit must flag arbitrary brackets');
});

it('zero arbitrary hex in class attributes', () => { /* /(bg|text|border|ring)-\[#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,6}\]/ */ });
it('3 radius tiers only (rounded-lg/xl/2xl; rounded-full for pills/badges/avatars)', () => { /* RADIUS_RE */ });
it('4px spacing grid, no .5 fractions, no arbitrary geometry', () => {
  // Strip the contract-approved arbitrary values FIRST (project-specific
  // whitelist from the plan, e.g. min-h-[640px] hero, h-[380px] cards,
  // outline-[3px] focus ring), then apply SPACING_HALF_RE + GEOMETRY_ARBITRARY_RE.
});
```

Rules for this file:

1. **Whitelist explicitly, by exact value** — every arbitrary geometry value the
   page contract approves (hero heights, card heights, focus-ring width) is
   stripped before the arbitrary-value check. Never whitelist by prefix
   (`min-h-[` would excuse `min-h-[1px]`), and never whitelist a whole utility
   class (`rounded-md` is not whitelistable — pills use `rounded-full`).
2. **The self-check test is mandatory** — it crashes the suite if any rule is
   weakened, which is what makes the audit tamper-evident.
3. **Fixing means changing the code, not the rules** — if the audit flags
   something the contract genuinely allows, add the exact value to the
   whitelist AND cite the contract section in a comment.

Then verify every in-scope state from the contract's Section 4 has a component,
and every generated component consumes tokens (no raw colors anywhere).

**Composition fidelity gate (separate layer, not optional).** The audit file above
proves token compliance; it says nothing about whether the page looks like the
reference. Run `references/fidelity-checklist.md`: dev server, capture at
1440 / 768 / 375, dispatch `multimodal-looker` with the reference plus the screenshots
against the contract's Section 5, and record PASS / FAIL per section row. Fix the
render, not the checklist. This gate is a measured checklist, never a pixel diff.

The canonical `design-contract-system` Phase 4 greps (hex / radius / spacing)
remain valid as a quick manual pre-check, but the file above is the enforced
gate — greps on a staged diff are not.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Inventing tokens**: a color/spacing value that is not in `TOKEN-MAP.md`/`THEME.md` — flag the contract gap instead
- **Happy-path shells**: page components without their state components — the single most common scaffold failure
- **Wrong animation tool**: Remotion for a hover animation, or `motion/react` for a rendered marketing video
- **Contract drift**: regenerating a page by hand after the contract changed — re-scaffold from the contract
- **Skipping the audit gate**: the canonical audit file exists because hex/radius/spacing violations are invisible in review screenshots
- **Writing your own audit test** (self-approval): a hand-rolled test that whitelists the output it was meant to check — the observed real-world failure. Only the canonical audit file (Phase 5), contract-owned, with the self-check test
- **Token-green, composition-drift**: treating a passing token audit as visual fidelity — the observed real-world failure (8 composition complaints under a 19/19 green token audit).
- **Treating the image tool as production storage**: generated images must land in the repo
